                        <h1>We Believe</h1>
                        <p>A truly smart kitchen should be able to handle each and every situation including gas leaks or electrical short circuits. During such hazardous conditions, all systems should be automatically shut down and the user has to be alerted immediately.It will be beneficial to incorporate intelligence and connectivity in a device like a cooktop, which is essential to every kitchen. We have in mind a smart hub that can understand your dietary habits and assist you in the kitchen. As our first step, we are building a stove top which can learn from your habits and also help you to take care of your family's nutrition. Surely this device can be improved upon to include upcoming technology to make your kitchen even better!”
